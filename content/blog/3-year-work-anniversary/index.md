It's this time of the year again. Today is my 3-year working anniversary. It's hard to believe that I have already worked in IBM Quantum for 3 years, but at the same time, the last 3 years felt like a lifetime, for most people in the world. Three years ago, COVID just started and no one could anticipate that it evolved into a global pandemic. The good news is that we have learned to live with COVID and things are getting back to normal, even though the "norm" will never be the same. 

I wrote a blog post for my 1-year working anniversary. I won't repeat things I mentioned there. If you are interested, you can read it here. I also wrote a draft for 2-year working anniversary but I got lazy and it never made it to the light. On the bright side, I have more things to say today :D 

## Highlights

First things first, here are some highlights of the least 2 years.

- **I moved to Spain.** It was definitely not easy to move across continents. But now that I have settled, I am really happy living in Spain. I live in the same city with my parents-in-law, so I have extra pairs of hands to help raise my daughter. People are much more friendly than those in Singapore. Daily interactions with strangers and acquaintances are much more pleasant even though speaking Spanish is still a challenge for me. Another huge benefits is the time zone. In Singapore I often need to work from 9pm till midnight because most meetings happen in US morning time, whereas the same meetings happen in Europe afternoons. Therefore I can work normal hours in Spain, disconnect from work and have a much better work-life balance.
- **I changed team**, from APAC community team to Qiskit DevRel team, still under the same, broader IBM Quantum Community Team. Now I work less on events and more with code and content.
- **I led the team behind IBM Quantum Challenge May 2021**. Learned a ton of things about leading a big cross-functional team. It is still one of my biggest (if not the biggest) achievements to date. And for that I received research accomplishment award.
- **Created Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program**. I am so happy to see so many advocates learned new skills and formed meaningful relationships with their mentors through this program. Also there are a lot of cool projects came out of the program, including Qiskit Ecosystem, qiskit-braket-provider and a few academic papers.
- **Revisited QPong**. If you know me, you know that QPong got me into IBM Quantum. So I was really happy to revisit it after a few years. I mentored three Qiskit advocates under QAMP to work on QPong 2.0. And I did a two-part live stream series on creating QPong from scratch.
- **Mentored intern Guillermo for his Master thesis**. 
- **Created Qiskit Docs Guide** with Guillermo. It's an important document to help qiskit developers create high quality documentation. I personally also learned a lot about writing documentation and using Sphinx in the process.
- **Obtained Open Source Strategic Committer badge and TCAP Open source award**. I contributed a few code PRs to qiskit-terra. Among them I am most proud of the PR to migrate fake backends from qiskit.test.mock to qiskit.providers.fake_provider. I learned a lot from doing that. Also through documentation and helping external contributors, I obtained write access to qiskit meta, qiskit-terra and maintainer access to qiskit-tutorials and qiskit_sphinx_theme.


## Challenges

- Changing team
- Changing the kind of work
- Seeing your impacts as a part of a bigger effort
- Doing more software than research
- Living in a new country
